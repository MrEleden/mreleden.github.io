## 👨‍💻 Professional Background

I'm a passionate **AI Engineer** and **Data Scientist** with expertise in building production-grade machine learning systems. My work focuses on transforming complex data into actionable insights through scalable ML models, data pipelines, and end-to-end MLOps solutions.

I specialize in the complete machine learning lifecycle—from problem formulation and exploratory data analysis to model deployment, monitoring, and optimization. My approach combines deep technical expertise with practical engineering to deliver solutions that create real business value.

### Core Competencies
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet) and deep learning architectures (LSTM, TCN, Transformers) with experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization, and production deployment
- **Computer Vision**: Semantic segmentation, object detection, model optimization for edge deployment, handling class imbalance, and ONNX export for inference
- **ML Engineering & MLOps**: End-to-end ML system design, feature engineering, model serving, CI/CD pipelines, experiment tracking (MLflow), orchestration (Hydra), containerization (Docker), model monitoring, and A/B testing
- **Recommendation Systems**: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, deep learning embeddings, and hybrid approaches with scalable production deployment

## 💼 Professional Experience

### AI Engineer
**Equans** | Paris, France | Jul. 2025 – Present

- Engineering the **full data pipeline from edge to model**: Azure IoT Hub → Event Hubs/Kafka → Palantir Foundry streaming ingestion, with batch processing on **Spark and Polars** for historical backfill and feature stores
- Building **distributed feature engineering on Spark** for predictive maintenance — computing rolling statistics, frequency-domain features, and cross-sensor correlations across fleets of industrial refrigeration units
- Developing **predictive maintenance models** combining streaming IoT sensor data (temperature, pressure, vibration) with offline ML pipelines for anomaly detection and remaining useful life estimation
- Implementing **model serving infrastructure** — online models for real-time alerting, offline models for long-horizon maintenance scheduling and fleet-level analytics
- Operating **end-to-end model monitoring**: data drift detection, prediction quality tracking, automated retraining triggers, and SLA-based alerting to ensure model reliability in production
- Owning the full **ML lifecycle in production** — from data engineering and feature engineering through training, deployment, A/B testing, and continuous monitoring

### Data Scientist
**Swiss Re** | Zurich, Switzerland | Sep. 2023 – Jun. 2025

- Built an **IFRS 17 actuarial/financial simulation engine** (cash flows, discounting, Contractual Service Margin) to benchmark EY outputs and ensure regulatory compliance
- Automated **end-to-end reconciliation** (General Ledger ↔ actuarial models), cutting manual work from multi-day reviews to **< 2 hours per run** and improving auditability & reproducibility
- Designed and optimized **PySpark pipelines in Palantir Foundry**, scaling to **10⁹+ accounting records per batch** and integrating with downstream financial reporting systems

### Data Scientist
**Pernod Ricard** | Paris, France | Jan. 2023 – Aug. 2023

- Developed **time-series forecasting and ML models** (ARIMA, gradient boosting) and designed a custom **PyTorch framework** for scalable training/inference
- Improved **3-month demand forecasts by 12%** vs. Financial Analyst baseline

### Research & Applied Scientist
**Synspective** | Tokyo, Japan | Dec. 2019 – Jan. 2023

- Automated detection of **new construction from SAR time series** (InSAR coherence + intensity), improving urban growth monitoring
- Delivered a **cloud-based Earth observation platform** with dynamic caching on Google Cloud, reducing data latency for SDG indicators in economics and environment
- Built scalable **object detection models for maritime trade** (containers, cars, trucks, ships); awarded **2nd Prize at the NEDO Challenge**
- Applied Earth observation and machine learning methods during **NASA, ESA & JAXA hackathons** to address real-world challenges such as wildfire monitoring and prediction

### Machine Learning Intern
**National Institute of Informatics** | Tokyo, Japan | Mar. 2019 – Aug. 2019

- Developed **action detection models** combining MobileNetV2 with segmentation/regression maps and LSTM for temporal recognition
- Integrated deep learning into **UAV systems** for search & rescue and surveillance; **published in IEEE Access**
