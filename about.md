## Experience

### AI Engineer
**Equans** | Paris, France | Jul. 2025 – Present

- Engineering the **full data pipeline from edge to model**: Azure IoT Hub → Event Hubs/Kafka → Palantir Foundry streaming ingestion, with batch processing on **Spark and Polars** for historical backfill and feature stores
- Building **distributed feature engineering on Spark** for predictive maintenance — rolling statistics, frequency-domain features, and cross-sensor correlations across fleets of industrial refrigeration units
- Developing **predictive maintenance models** combining streaming IoT sensor data (temperature, pressure, vibration) with offline ML pipelines for anomaly detection and remaining useful life estimation
- Implementing **model serving infrastructure** — online models for real-time alerting, offline models for long-horizon maintenance scheduling and fleet-level analytics
- Operating **end-to-end model monitoring**: data drift detection, prediction quality tracking, automated retraining triggers, and SLA-based alerting
- Owning the full **ML lifecycle in production** — from data engineering through training, deployment, A/B testing, and continuous monitoring

### Data Scientist
**Swiss Re** | Zurich, Switzerland | Sep. 2023 – Jun. 2025

- Built an **IFRS 17 actuarial/financial simulation engine** (cash flows, discounting, Contractual Service Margin) to benchmark EY outputs and ensure regulatory compliance
- Automated **end-to-end reconciliation** (General Ledger ↔ actuarial models), cutting manual work from multi-day reviews to **< 2 hours per run** and improving auditability & reproducibility
- Designed and optimized **PySpark pipelines in Palantir Foundry**, scaling to **10⁹+ accounting records per batch** and integrating with downstream financial reporting systems

### Data Scientist
**Pernod Ricard** | Paris, France | Jan. 2023 – Aug. 2023

- Developed **time-series forecasting and ML models** (ARIMA, gradient boosting) and designed a custom **PyTorch framework** for scalable training/inference
- Improved **3-month demand forecasts by 12%** vs. Financial Analyst baseline

### Research & Applied Scientist
**Synspective** | Tokyo, Japan | Dec. 2019 – Jan. 2023

- Automated detection of **new construction from SAR time series** (InSAR coherence + intensity), improving urban growth monitoring
- Delivered a **cloud-based Earth observation platform** with dynamic caching on Google Cloud, reducing data latency for SDG indicators
- Built scalable **object detection models for maritime trade** (containers, cars, trucks, ships); awarded **2nd Prize at the NEDO Challenge**
- Applied ML at **NASA, ESA & JAXA hackathons** for wildfire monitoring and prediction

### Machine Learning Intern
**National Institute of Informatics** | Tokyo, Japan | Mar. 2019 – Aug. 2019

- Developed **action detection models** combining MobileNetV2 with segmentation/regression maps and LSTM for temporal recognition
- Integrated deep learning into **UAV systems** for search & rescue; **published in IEEE Access**
