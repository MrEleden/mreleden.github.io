## Machine Learning Engineering

### [Machine Learning Engineering](http://www.mlebook.com/)
**by Andriy Burkov**

A comprehensive guide to building production-ready machine learning systems. This book covers the entire ML lifecycle from problem formulation to deployment and monitoring.

**Key Topics**:
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter optimization
- ML system design and architecture
- Model deployment and serving
- Monitoring and maintenance

**Why I recommend it**: Bridges the gap between academic ML and real-world engineering practices. Essential for anyone moving from research to production ML systems.

## AI Engineering

### [AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/)
**by Chip Huyen**

A comprehensive guide to building AI applications with foundation models (LLMs, vision models, multimodal models). Focuses on practical engineering challenges of developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems powered by foundation models.

**Key Topics**:
- Foundation models and their capabilities
- Prompt engineering and optimization
- Model evaluation and testing
- Fine-tuning and adaptation strategies
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- AI system design patterns
- Model deployment and serving
- Cost optimization and latency management
- Safety, security, and responsible AI

**Why I recommend it**: Essential for understanding how to build production AI applications in the era of foundation models. Covers the complete lifecycle from prompt design to deployment, with practical engineering insights for working with LLMs and other foundation models.

## üí° Why These Books Matter

These books emphasize the engineering aspects of machine learning that are often overlooked in academic settings:

- **End-to-end thinking**: From problem formulation to production deployment
- **System design**: Building scalable, maintainable ML infrastructure
- **Production considerations**: Monitoring, debugging, and maintaining ML systems
- **Real-world constraints**: Latency, cost, reliability, and business impact

If you're transitioning from ML research to ML engineering, or building production ML systems, these are essential reads.
