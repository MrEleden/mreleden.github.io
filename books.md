## Machine Learning Engineering

### [Machine Learning Engineering](http://www.mlebook.com/)
**by Andriy Burkov**

A comprehensive guide to building production-ready machine learning systems. This book covers the entire ML lifecycle from problem formulation to deployment and monitoring.

**Key Topics**:
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter optimization
- ML system design and architecture
- Model deployment and serving
- Monitoring and maintenance

**Why I recommend it**: Bridges the gap between academic ML and real-world engineering practices. Essential for anyone moving from research to production ML systems.

## AI Engineering

### [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/)
**by Chip Huyen**

An in-depth guide to designing reliable, scalable, and maintainable ML systems in production. Focuses on the engineering challenges of deploying ML at scale.

**Key Topics**:
- ML system design patterns
- Data engineering for ML
- Feature stores and feature engineering
- Model deployment strategies
- Continual learning and model updates
- ML monitoring and observability
- A/B testing and experimentation
- Edge deployment and optimization

**Why I recommend it**: Covers the complete spectrum of building production ML systems, from data pipelines to monitoring. Invaluable for understanding how to operationalize ML at scale.

## üí° Why These Books Matter

These books emphasize the engineering aspects of machine learning that are often overlooked in academic settings:

- **End-to-end thinking**: From problem formulation to production deployment
- **System design**: Building scalable, maintainable ML infrastructure
- **Production considerations**: Monitoring, debugging, and maintaining ML systems
- **Real-world constraints**: Latency, cost, reliability, and business impact

If you're transitioning from ML research to ML engineering, or building production ML systems, these are essential reads.
