# Mathias Villerabel — ML Engineer

I build machine learning systems that ship. Currently at Equans, I engineer the **full stack from IoT sensors to production ML** — Azure IoT Hub, Kafka, Spark/Polars pipelines, distributed feature engineering, and model serving/monitoring on Palantir Foundry for industrial refrigeration. Previously at Swiss Re I built PySpark pipelines processing **10⁹+ accounting records per batch**, an **IFRS 17 simulation engine**, and automated reconciliation from multi-day reviews to **< 2 hours**. At Pernod Ricard I improved demand forecasts by **12%** over analyst baselines.

## Featured Projects

### [Time Series Forecasting at Scale](./projects.html#project1)

![Forecasting Dashboard](./assets/img/Screenshot%202025-10-15%20120608.png)

Production-grade forecasting portfolio with 10+ model architectures across retail, rideshare, and inventory domains. Config-driven (Hydra), tracked (MLflow), optimized (Optuna), containerized (Docker), served (FastAPI).
- **Results**: 7.1% MAPE on Walmart retail, 80K+ samples processed
- **Live Demo**: [Try the Streamlit App](https://forecastingdemo-jgkrsrcxen3wzvjcappbgra.streamlit.app/)

### [Movie Recommendation System](./projects.html#project2)

![Movie Recommendation System](./assets/img/Screenshot%202025-10-20%20113817.png)

End-to-end recommendation system — 4 model architectures, 100K+ ratings, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio and Streamlit interfaces.
- **Results**: RMSE ~0.323, full ML lifecycle from training to global inference API
- **Live Demo**: [Try on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MrEleden/movie-reco-demo)

### [Floorplan Wall Segmentation](./projects.html#project3)

![Wall Segmentation](./assets/img/best_validation_sample.png)

Computer vision for architectural floorplan segmentation — DeepLabV3 + ResNet50 handling extreme class imbalance (96.2% background vs 3.7% walls). ONNX export for cross-platform deployment.
- **Results**: 99.4% accuracy, 80K+ training samples, 50ms inference
